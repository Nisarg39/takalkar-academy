            agree to have a public profile in order for their content to be
            published. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information
            on your profile. You should not add personal data to your profile
            that you would not want to be publicly available.

            <strong>Use of Business Information by other third parties</strong>

          <p>
            1. We partner with third-party advertising networks to either
            display advertising on our Website or to manage our advertising on
            other Websites. These ad network partners do not collect and do not

            of cookies.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. We make reasonable efforts to make sure that our users, who use
            our Services, will use the information available to them solely for
            TAKALKAR-related purposes. However, we cannot control their use of
            that information outside this scope and we are not responsible for

          <p>
            Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information
            described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the personal
            information concerned and the specific context in which we collect
            and use it. We will normally collect personal information from you
            where we need the personal information to perform a contract with
            you (for example to provide our services to you), where the
            processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your
            data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (for
            example our direct marketing activities in accordance with your
            preferences), or where we have your consent to do so (for example,
            for you to participate in specific surveys and focus groups).
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect
            personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal
            information to protect your vital interests or those of another
            person (for example to prevent payment fraud or confirm your
            identity).
          </p>
          <p>
            For questions about our use of your personal information (including
            legal basis and transfer mechanisms we rely on) please contact our

          <h2>5. Protection of Information</h2>
          <p>
            We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial
            measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft
            and unauthorised access, use and modification. These measures are
            designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risks of
            processing your personal information. Indicatively :
          </p>
          <p>
            1. All our employees, independent contractors and agents have
            executed non-disclosure agreements, which provide explicit
            confidentiality protections. Any employee, independent contractor or
            agent who violates such privacy and/or security policies is subject
            to possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. We do not make any of your Information available to third parties
            for their marketing purposes. Takalkar Academy’s software runs on
            individual servers and no data given or collected is shared with
            other social media platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            If however, we share your Information with third parties, we will
            notify you. Please note that no transmission over the internet can
            guarantee confidentiality and non-disclosure, and as such, you
            transmit at your own risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. We use robust security measures to protect data from unauthorized
            access, maintain data accuracy, and help ensure the appropriate use
            of data. When the Services are accessed using the internet, Secure
            Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects your Information, using both
            server authentication and data encryption. These technologies help
            ensure that your Information is safe, secure, and only available to
            you and to whom you have granted access.
          </p>
          <p>

            spam, please contact us at takalkarjeeneetacademy09@gmail.com You may
